# chessSpeak.py Execution
When running chessSpeak, the terminal will remain open (Don't close it) and chess.com will open in a new browser. From here you can:

1. Firstly close all the annoying popups
2. Choose which player to play against. Click on their face, then and click Choose
3. Pick your challenge
4. Click Play

The game is on! When it's your turn, click 'Enter' inside the terminal and say a move, for example, 'A2 to A4'. Be quick bevause you only have 4 seconds.

Sometimes, the program won't quite recognise your move. If so, it will say 'Invalid move' in the terminal, and you can try again by repeating the above.

When a valid move has been entered, your chess piece will move, then the opponent will move, rinse and repeat.
